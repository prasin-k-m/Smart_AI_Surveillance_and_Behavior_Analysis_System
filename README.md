# **Smart AI Surveillance & Behavior Analysis System**

### **Project Status:** Active Development

This system is currently under development. New features and optimizations are being added continuously.

## **Description**

An **AI-powered intelligent surveillance system** that detects **weapons, analyzes human behavior, identifies individuals, and assesses threat levels in real time** using computer vision and deep learning.

This project integrates **YOLO object detection, MediaPipe pose estimation, and face recognition** into a unified pipeline capable of generating **real-time alerts, risk assessments, and incident logs**.

## **Key Features**

- **Person Detection & Tracking** (YOLOv8)
- **Custom Weapon Detection Model** (Gun / Knife detection)
- **Human Behavior Analysis** using MediaPipe Pose
- **Face Recognition for Identity Verification**
- **Risk Scoring Engine** (Low → Critical)
- **Real-time Alert System**
- **Incident Snapshot Capture**
- **Event Logging with Timestamp**
- **Security Monitoring Dashboard**
- **Modular Architecture for Production Deployment**

## **AI Models Used**

#### 1.Person Detection

Pretrained **YOLOv8 model** used to detect and track people.

#### 2.Weapon Detection

Custom YOLO model trained on a dataset containing:

   - Guns

   - Knives

Training performed using **Ultralytics YOLOv8 framework**.

#### 3.Pose Detection

MediaPipe Pose is used to detect posture states:

   - Standing

   - Hands Raised

   - Fallen Person

#### 4.Face Recognition

Face embeddings are extracted and matched against a **known identity database**.

## **Risk Assessment Logic**

The system computes a risk score using multiple signals.

| Condition       | Risk Points |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Weapon detected | +5          |
| Unknown person  | +2          |
| Hands raised    | +3          |
| Fallen posture  | +2          |

Risk levels:
```
0–2   → LOW
3–4   → MEDIUM
5–7   → HIGH
8+    → CRITICAL
```

Alerts are triggered when risk level reaches **HIGH or CRITICAL**.

## **Event Logging**

Every alert is recorded with a timestamp:

Timestamp | TrackID | Name | Posture | Armed | RiskLevel

Example log:

2026-03-04 12:31:22 | ID 3 | Unknown | HANDS UP | True | CRITICAL

Logs are stored in:

event_log.csv
📸 Incident Capture

When a high-risk event occurs, the system automatically stores a snapshot:

incidents/
   incident_3_20260304_123122.jpg

These images can be reviewed by security personnel.

📡 Alert API

The system can send alerts to an external monitoring server.

Example API payload:

{
  "track_id": 3,
  "name": "Unknown",
  "posture": "HANDS UP",
  "armed": true,
  "risk": "CRITICAL"
}
